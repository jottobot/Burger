## Usage
Upon visiting the heroku site, the user will see a list of burgers they can "devour." By clicking the devour button, the burger will move from being on the menu to the devoured list. 

The user can also add a burger to the menu that in turn can also be devoured.

All of the burgers will be held in a database.
